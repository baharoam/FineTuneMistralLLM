# Mistral Fine-Tuning with LoRA

## Overview

In this project, we fine-tune the Mistral model using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique. The goal is to enhance the model's ability to adapt to new and specific data by improving its learning. Rather than adjusting all model parameters, LoRA focuses on making small changes to a subset of parameters, resulting in faster training and reduced memory consumption.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Carefully preprocess the text data to remove any noise or irrelevant information.
   
2. **Model Tuning**
   - Fine-tune the Mistral model using the prepared training data and the LoRA technique. This step involves training the model and adjusting it to optimally adapt to the new data.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on a test dataset to assess its accuracy and efficiency in text classification.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your text data for preprocessing.
2. Apply the LoRA technique to fine-tune the Mistral model.
3. Evaluate the fine-tuned model to measure its performance.
